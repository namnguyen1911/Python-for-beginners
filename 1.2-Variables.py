#1.2 Variables in Python

#----------------------------------------

#Variable is used to store data values

#Unlike other language, Python does not need developer to declare the variable types

#Variable type can be flexibly changed depends on user input

a = 5       #declare variable a as an integer 
print (a)

a = "Tom"   #declare the variable a above as a string
print (a)

#Note: "Tom" is the same thing as 'Tom'

#----------------------------------------

#Naming Variable

#Variable names can be lowercase, uppercase, number, and underscore

firstvar = 0
first_var = 0
first_var_ = 0
_first_var = 0
FirstVar = 0
FIRSTVAR = 0
first1var = 0
firstvar1 = 0

#variable cannot contain hyphen, space and number at the beginning

#first-var = 0
#first var = 0
#1firstvar = 0
